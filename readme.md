## Powershell scripts for installing WSL
### Created by Damon Murdoch 

## Description
These Powershell scripts have been developed for the purpose of installing and updating WSL to work with WSL2 automatically. The installer works in two parts, as the first script requires a restart to complete. The second script performs the cleanup tasks and then opens the WSL library in the Windows Store.
